            A fully-online, people-focused, 24-hour hackathon that brings people
            together to solve the worldâ€™s biggest problems. With the COVID-19
            pandemic disrupting many internships, post-secondary studies, and
            many student-oriented STEM opportunities, our hackathon aims to give
            you the power to create even during a time of crisis.
